1. [Task 1 Titanic SURVIVAL PREDICTION - In this task, I developed and trained predictive models to make informed predictions about passenger survival, thus gaining valuable insights into the factors that played a role in determining who survived the historic maritime disaster.Titanic Survival Prediction is a popular introductory machine learning project that utilizes the Titanic dataset to create a predictive model. This dataset comprises detailed information about passengers who were aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and most importantly, whether they survived the tragic sinking or not.
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a given passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on the available information. This task serves as a valuable entry point for individuals learning data science and machine learning, as it involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. Ultimately, it offers a practical example of how machine learning can be used to make predictions and gain insights from historical data.
2. [Task 2 MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON] -The project involves several essential steps, including data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling. By exploring these techniques, the project aims to gain insights into the factors that influence movie ratings. Ultimately, the goal is to create a robust and accurate model capable of estimating movie ratings based on relevant attributes, which can be valuable for both movie enthusiasts and industry professionals."Movie Rating Prediction with Python" is a data science project focused on developing a predictive model to estimate the rating of movies based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. This project typically employs regression techniques in Python to address the task. The primary objective is to analyze historical movie data, perform data analysis, preprocessing, and feature engineering to better understand the factors influencing movie ratings.
By utilizing machine learning modeling techniques, this project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the ratings that movies might receive from users or critics. It serves as a valuable learning opportunity for data scientists and enthusiasts to gain insights into the intricate relationship between movie features and audience ratings. Ultimately, the project empowers individuals to create a reliable tool for estimating movie ratings, facilitating informed decision-making in the film industry and movie-related endeavors.
3. [Task 3 IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION] - The Iris Flower Classification task involves using the Iris flower dataset, which consists of three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species are characterized by their unique measurements, specifically those of their sepals and petals. The goal of this classification task is to create a machine learning model that can analyze these measurements and accurately categorize Iris flowers into their respective species.
This dataset is a popular choice for introductory classification exercises in machine learning due to its simplicity and well-defined classes. It serves as an excellent starting point for learning about the fundamentals of classification algorithms and their application in real-world scenarios.
